* Go What?
.image ./gopher.png _ 300

- Opinionated
- Dependencies built-in binaries
- Concurrency Primitives

* Go Where?

.image ./docker-logo.png _ 150
.image ./kubernetes.svg _ 150
.image ./mozilla.png _ 150
.image ./twitch.png _ 150

* Background - Single Threaded vs. Multi Threaded
- Single Threaded: One function after another
- Multi-Threaded: independent functions share resources

- picture of mining gopher

* One Gopher Architecture
- picture of mining gopher one thread arch

* One Gopher Code
.play ./exec/singleThreaded.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Multi Gophered Architecture
- picture of multi threaded go arch

* Tools We'll Need
- A way to create Gophers
- A way to communicate between Gophers

* Go Routines
- Gopher being born picture

* Two Gophers, One Mine
.play ./exec/twoFinders.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Current Status
- Create multiple threads easily
- Even more lightweight that a normal 'thread'
- But How will we communicate between gophers?

* Channels
- Image of gophers on cans

* Channel Creation
- Image of channel being created
.code ./examples/firstChannel.go /^func main/,/^}/


* Sending / Receiving on Channels
- Image of Sending on a Channel
.code ./examples/firstChannelSend.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Example of sending / receiving on a channel

* Channel Blocking
- Allows go routines to 'sync' back up

* Blocking on a Send
- Image of gopher sleeping on a send

* Blocking on a Receive
- Image of gopher sleeing on a receive

* Unbuffered Channels
- Image of unbuffered channel

* Buffered Channels
- Image of buffered channel
.code ./examples/bufferedChannel.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Buffered Channels cont
- Image of no blocking interactions

* Buffered Channels Example
- Example code of non-blocking buffered channels

* Putting it all Together
- Image of full program

* Full Program
- Code example of full program

* Before you go, you should know..
Anonymous Go Routines
- Image of anonymous go routine
.code ./examples/anonymous.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Main Function is a Go Routine
- Image of king Gopher
- Example of stalled and unstalled go program

* Better ways than time out
- I'm done gopher image

* You can range over a channel
- Read values as they come in

* Non-blocking reads / writes
- Code of select / default example

* Where to learn next
- Image of gopher reading
