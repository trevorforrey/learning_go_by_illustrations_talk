* Go What?
.image ./imgs/gopher.png _ 300

Developed at Google in 2009

What makes it so great?
- Opinionated
- Dependencies built-in binaries
- Concurrency Primitives
- Amazing Community

: Opinionated: Formats your code for you If you have a variable that isn't used, your program won't compile
: Compiles down to a binary with/ dependencies inside. don't even need the go sdk to run on another computer
: Concurrency is at the forefront in Go, and the language was designed to allow for simple and powerful concurrent programs

* Go Where?

.image ./imgs/docker-logo.png _ 150
.image ./imgs/kubernetes.svg _ 150
.image ./imgs/mozilla.png _ 150
.image ./imgs/twitch.png _ 150

* Background - Single Threaded vs. Multi Threaded
- Single Threaded: One function after another
- Multi-Threaded: independent functions share resources

.image ./imgs/WorkingGopher.jpg _ 500

: Explain differences between single & multi threaded programs
: Talk about mining example

* One Gopher Architecture
.image ./imgs/single_arch.jpg _ 950

: one gopher performs all functions

* One Gopher Code
.play ./exec/1_singleThreaded.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Multi Gophered Architecture
.image ./imgs/independent_arch.jpg _ 950

: multiple gophers perform a separate function

* Tools We'll Need
- A way to create Gophers
- A way to communicate between Gophers

: End on 'Now how do we create Gophers?'

* Go Routines
.image ./imgs/eggsGopher.jpg _ 950

* Two Gophers, One Mine
.play ./exec/2_twoFinders.go /^func main/,/^}/

* What if we want to be sneaky? (Anonymous Go Routines)
.image ./imgs/bigAnonGopher.jpg _ 700
.code ./examples/anonymous.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Current Status
- Start up go routines easily
- Even more lightweight than a normal 'thread'
- But how will we communicate between gophers?

* Channels
.image ./imgs/gopher_cans.jpg _ 900

* Channel Creation
.image ./imgs/channel.jpg _ 900
.code ./examples/firstChannel.go /^func main/,/^}/


* Sending / Receiving on Channels
.image ./imgs/channek_send.jpg _ 900
.code ./examples/firstChannelSend.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Example of sending / receiving on a channel
.play ./exec/3_exampleSendReceive.go /^func main/,/^}/


* Channel Blocking
- Allows go routines to 'sync' back up

* Blocking on a Send
.image ./imgs/blockOnSend.jpg _ 900
.play ./exec/4_blockOnSend.go /^func main/,/^}/


* Blocking on a Receive
.image ./imgs/blockonRec.jpg _ 900
.play ./exec/5_blockOnReceive.go /^func main/,/^}/


* Unbuffered Channels
.image ./imgs/bigoneChannel.jpg _ 900
.code ./examples/firstChannel.go /^func main/,/^}/


* Buffered Channels
.image ./imgs/bigmultiChannel.jpg _ 900
.code ./examples/bufferedChannel.go /^func main/,/^}/


* Buffered Channels cont
.image ./imgs/channel_sends.jpg _ 900
Now we don't block on every channel write/read!


* Buffered Channels Example
.play ./exec/6_bufferedChannelsExample.go /^func main/,/^}/


* Current Status
- Create Go Routines (Gophers)
- Create Channels
- You are all Masters of Concurrency!


* Desired Pipeline
.image ./imgs/independent_arch.jpg _ 950

* Final Pipeline
.play ./exec/7_finalPipeline.go /^func main/,/^}/

* But what if I need to have more gophers (for speed of course)?!
Let's get fancy....by passing and returning channels
.image ./imgs/AsynchMultWorkers.svg _ 500

* Passing in / returning a channel
.code ./examples/generatorStructure.go /^func gen/,/^}/


* Passing in / returning a channel
.code ./exec/8_passInAndReturnChannel.go /^func gen/,/^}/


* Passing in / returning a channel contd
.code ./exec/8_passInAndReturnChannel.go /^func finder/,/^}/


* Passing in / returning a channel example
.play ./exec/8_passInAndReturnChannel.go /^func main/,/^}/


* Full Program
.play ./exec/9_allTogether.go /^func main/,/^}/


* What's the Point though?
If we can pass in and return channels, we can share channels between multiple
Go routines (Gophers).

- Concurrency Pattern: Fan In / Fan Out


* Fan Out
.image ./imgs/fanOut.jpg _ 700


* Fan In
.image ./imgs/fanIn.jpg _ 900


* Now we can do stuff like this
.image ./imgs/AsynchMultWorkers.svg _ 500


* Before You Go...
You should know!


* Main Function is a Go Routine
.image ./imgs/mainGopher.jpg _ 900
.play ./exec/10_mainGopherExample.go /^func main/,/^}/

: Special because once the main go routine terminates, all over go routines terminate as well.

* Better ways than time out
.image ./imgs/imdonegopher.jpg _ 700
.play ./exec/11_imdone.go /^func main/,/^}/

* Non-blocking reads
.play ./exec/12_nonblockingRead.go /^func main/,/^}/

: 'Homeowner, did the package come?, No? Ok, well I'll go do something else'

* Non-blocking writes
.play ./exec/13_nonblockingWrite.go /^func main/,/^}/

: 'Mail man, is anyone home? Ehh, I guess I'll come back later'
